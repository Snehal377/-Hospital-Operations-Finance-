The Hospital Operations Finance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital 
financial performance, operational efficiency, and clinical complexity. 
It is designed to help hospital administrators, finance teams, and data analysts monitor 
revenue trends, case mix index (CMI), insurance contribution, specialty performance, 
and patient severity patterns.

This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by combining operational and 
financial KPIs into a single interactive view.
